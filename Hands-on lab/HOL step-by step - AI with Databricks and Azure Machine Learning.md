# Machine Learning hands-on lab step-by-step 

## Abstract and learning objectives 

In this lab, you will use Azure Databricks in combination with Azure Machine Learning service to build, train and deploy the desired models. You will learn:
  - How to train a forecasting model against time series data without any code by using automated machine learning.
  - How to create a recurrent neural network (RNN) model using PyTorch in Azure Databricks that can be used to forecast against time-series data.
  - How to use a trained forecast model to score data in real-time using Spark Structured Streaming within Azure Databricks.
  - How to train an Natural Language Processing text classification model using Keras.

## Overview

Trey Research Inc. delivers innovative solutions for manufacturers. They specialize in identifying and solving problems for manufacturers that can run the range from automating away mundane but time-intensive processes to delivering cutting edge approaches that provide new opportunities for their manufacturing clients. 

Trey Research is looking to provide the next generation experience for connected car manufacturers by enabling them to utilize AI to decide when to pro-actively reach out to the customer thru alerts delivered directly to the car's in-dash information and entertainment head unit. For their PoC, they would like to focus on two maintenance related scenarios.

In the first scenario, Trey Research recently instituted new regulations defining what parts are compliant or out of compliance. Rather than rely on their technicians to assess compliance, they would like to automatically assess the compliance based on component notes already entered by authorized technicians. Specifically they are looking to leverage Deep Learning technologies with Natural Language Processing techniques to scan through vehicle specification documents to find compliance issues with new regulations. Then each car is evaluated for out compliance components. 

In the second scenario, Trey Research would like to predict the likelihood of battery failure based on the telemetry stream of time series data that the car provides about how the battery performs when the car is started, how it is charging while running and how well it is holding its charge, among other factors. If they detect a battery failure is imminent within the next 30 days, they would like to send an alert.

Upon detection of an out of compliance component or a battery at risk of failure, they would like to be able to send an alert directly to the customer inviting them to schedule a service appointment to replace the part. 

In building this PoC, Trey Research wants to understand how they might use machine learning or deep learning in both scenarios, and standardize the platform that would support the data processing, model management and inferencing aspects of each. 

They are also interested to learn what new capabilities Azure provides that might help them to document and explain the models that are created to non-data scientists or might accelerate their time to creating production ready, performant models. 

In this lab, you will use Azure Databricks in combination with Azure Machine Learning service to build, train and deploy the desired models. 

## Solution architecture

The following diagram summarizes the key components and processing steps in the lab.

![Overall solution diagram, described in the text that follows.](images/lab-architecture.png)

In this lab, models are trained using both Azure Databricks (for deep learning with the PyTorch and Keras frameworks) and Azure Machine Learning compute (for automated machine learning using the user experience in the Azure Portal). Models are registered with the Azure Machine Learning Workspace. The data used for model training is read from Azure Storage. 

The scoring is performed using notebooks running within Azure notebooks, which show how to load and apply the respective models against the data provided. 

## Requirements

1.  Microsoft Azure subscription must be pay-as-you-go or MSDN

    a. Trial subscriptions will not work. You will run into issues with Azure resource quota limits.

    b. Subscriptions with access limited to a single resource group will not work. You will need the ability to deploy multiple resource groups.

## Before the hands-on lab

Refer to the Before the hands-on lab setup guide manual before continuing to the lab exercises.

## Exercise 1: Creating a forecast model using automated machine learning

Duration: 30 minutes

In this exercise, you will create a model that predicts battery failure from time-series data using the visual interface to automated machine learning in an Azure Machine Learning workspace. 

### Task 1: Create an automated machine learning experiment

1. Navigate to your Azure Machine Learning workspace in the Azure Portal.
2. Select `Automated machine learning` in the left navigation bar.
3. Select  **Create Experiment**.
   
   ![Create new experiment](./images/02_CreateExperiment.png)

4. Provide the experiment name: `Battery-Cycles` and select **Create a new compute**.
   
   ![Provide experiment name and click on compute](./images/03_NewExperiment_1.png)


5. For the new compute, provide the following values and then select **Create**:
   - Compute name: `auto-ml-compute`
   - VM size: `STANDARD_DS11_V2`
   - Select `Additional Settings` and set Minimum number of nodes and Maximum number of nodes to `1`.
   
      ![Create new compute](./images/04_CreateNewCompute.png)

6. Wait for the Compute to be ready and select **Next**. Now you will upload the training data. Start by downloading the data from https://databricksdemostore.blob.core.windows.net/data/connected-car/daily-battery-time-series.csv. Please ensure that the extension of the downloaded file is **csv**. Select **Upload** and then in the dialog that appears choose the file `daily-battery-time-series.csv` from your local disk.
   
   ![Uploading the training data](./images/05_UploadDataFile.png)

7. Select **daily-battery-time-series.csv** and review the training data. Be sure to scroll to the right to observe the target column `Daily_Cycles_Used`. Toggle the switch above the following columns so the header reads `Ignored` for the first unlabeled column, `number_of_trips`, `lifetime_cycles_used` and `battery_rated_cycles` columns.
   
   ![Reviewing the training data](./images/06_ReviewDataFile.png)

8. Now, you will setup the Auto ML Experiment Basic Settings by providing the following values:
   - Prediction Task: select **Forecasting**
   - Target column: select **Daily_Cycles_Used**
   - Time column: select **Date**
   - Series name column(s): **Battery_ID**
   - Forecast Horizon: enter `30`. This refers to forecasting out up to 30 days. 

      ![Setup Auto ML experiment basic settings](./images/07_SetupExp_1.png)

9. Select **Advanced Settings** to expand that area. Provide the following settings:
   - Primary metric: **normalized_root-mean_squared_error**
   - Max number of iterations: **10**
   - Number of Cross Validations: **5**
   - Max concurrent iterations: **1**
   
     ![Configuring the Advanced Settings as described](./images/08_SetupExp_2.png)

10. Select **Start** to run the experiment and begin automated machine learning process.
    
### Task 2: Review the experiment run results

1. The experiment will run for about *5-10 minutes*. Once it completes you should examine the chart to observe the model performance for the primary metric for different iterations. 
   
   ![Review run details - graph view](./images/09_ReviewRunDetails_1.png)

2. Scroll down to see a table view of different iterations and select the iteration with the best **normalized root mean square error** score. Note that the normalized root mean square error measures the error between the predicted value and actual value. In this case, the model with the lowest normalized root mean square error is the best model.
   
   ![Review run details - table view](./images/010_ReviewRunDetails_2.png)


### Task 3: Register the Best Model
1. Return to the top of the `Run Details` screen and select **Deploy Best Model** as shown. Note that deployment consists of four steps: (1) *Register Best Model*, (2) Download *Scoring and Environment Script files*, (3) Create *Deployment Image* using the downloaded script files, and (4) Deploy *Scoring Web Service* using the created image.
   
   ![The Deploy Best Model button](./images/014_DeployBestModel.png)

2. You register the best model with the Azure Machine Learning service model registry so that you can retrieve it later when you want to use it for scoring. Select **Register Model** link. Once the registration process has completed, the link will change to the text `Model has been registered`.
   
   ![Register Best Model](./images/015_RegisterModel.png)

3. The model registration, will create a new model in your Azure Machine Learning workspace with the same name as the experiment: `Battery-Cycles`. To view this model from the Azure Machine Learning workspace, select **Models**. 
   
   ![Viewing the list of models in the Azure Machine Learning workspace](images/03-automl-registered-model.png)

4. If you see your model in the above list, you are now ready to continue on to the next exercise.

## Exercise 2: Understanding the automated ML generated forecast model using model explainability 

Duration: 15 minutes

### Task 1: Explore the model using a notebook

1. Browse to your Azure Databricks Workspace and open `AI with Databricks and AML \ Model Explainability`. This is the notebook you will step thru executing in this lab.
2. Follow the instructions within the notebook to complete the lab.
3. Note that in this notebook, and the following notebooks, we are using the default storage account in Azure Databricks. However, the best practice in enterprises is to use a shared storage account that you mount to your Azure Databricks. Also, you can use [Secrets in Azure Key Vaults](https://docs.azuredatabricks.net/user-guide/secrets/secrets.html) that can be read by the notebooks to save sensitive data, such as your subscription ID.


## Exercise 3: Creating a deep learning model (RNN) for time series data and registering the model

Duration: 45 minutes

### Task 1: Create the model using a notebook

1. Browse to your Azure Databricks Workspace and open `AI with Databricks and AML \ Deep Learning with Time Series`. This is the notebook you will step thru executing in this lab.
2. Follow the instructions within the notebook to complete the lab.


## Exercise 4: Using a forecast model for scoring of streaming telemetry

Duration: 45 minutes

In this exercise, you will apply the forecast model to a Spark streaming job in order to make predictions against streaming data.

### Task 1: Create the streaming job using a notebook

1. Browse to your Azure Databricks Workspace and navigate to `AI with Databricks and AML \ Stream Scoring`. This is the notebook you will step thru executing in this lab.
2. Follow the instructions within the notebook to complete the lab.

## Exercise 5: Creating a deep learning text classification model

Duration: 45 minutes

In this exercise, you create a model for classifying component text as compliant or non-compliant.

### Task 1: Create the classification model using a notebook

1. Browse to your Azure Databricks Workspace and navigate to `AI with Databricks and AML \ Deep Learning with Text`. This is the notebook you will step thru executing in this lab.
2. Follow the instructions within the notebook to complete the lab.


## After the hands-on lab 

Duration: 5 minutes

To avoid unexpected charges, it is recommended that you clean up all of your lab resources when you complete the lab.

### Task 1: Clean up lab resources

1.  Navigate to the Azure Portal and locate the `MCW-AI-Lab` Resource Group you created for this lab.

2.  Select **Delete resource group** from the command bar.

    ![Screenshot of the Delete resource group button.](images/image71.png 'Delete resource group button')

3.  In the confirmation dialog that appears, enter the name of the resource group and select **Delete**.

4.  Wait for the confirmation that the Resource Group has been successfully deleted. If you don't wait, and the delete fails for some reason, you may be left with resources running that were not expected. You can monitor using the Notifications dialog, which is accessible from the Alarm icon.

    ![The Notifications dialog box has a message stating that the resource group is being deleted.](images/image72.png 'Notifications dialog box')

5.  When the Notification indicates success, the cleanup is complete.
